# FaceRecognition-OpenCV-RaspberryPi

For this project you require
1.Raspberry Pi
2.Pi Cam
3.Python 3
4.OpenCV

We have to first detect the face, gather the data of the faces, train and recognize the faces.

I am using the Rasbian OS for the Raspberry Pi3B+. The NOOBS OS can be used for this project as well.

Steps:

-Enable Camera from the interface options in the terminal (raspi-config)
-Install OpenCV3
-After Installing OpenCV Test Your Camera by using the simpleCamTest.py File
